                    <p>Hello there, My name is Pablo, I'm a full stack web developer in the Phoenix area. Itâ€™s amazing all the awesome things you can build with some coding and a little bit of imagination right?!</p>
                    <br/>
                    <p>
                   I have a degree in web and graphic design, I also recently had the oportunity to attend DevMountain, an immersive three month coding bootcamp. Through my experience there I was able to build Full Stack Web Applications using P.E.R.N stack "PostgreSql, Express.js, React.js and Node.js". I also had the opportunity to collaborate with other classmates in group projects. 
                    </p>
                    <br/>
                    <p>
                        Besides coding, I like to do outdoor activities such as hiking, camping and explore Arizona's beautiful backcountry.
                    </p>
                    <br/>
                    <p>
                        I'm passionate about what I do and would like to collaborate with your projects. Let's connect!
